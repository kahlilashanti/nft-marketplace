# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
## use npm run dev to view the page in the browser
## to test the client side UI go to a terminal window and run npx hardhad node 
## in another terminal window use the command npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
## copy the nft market address and the nft address and paste it into the config.js file
## to test it out on the client side run npm run dev from a terminal window
